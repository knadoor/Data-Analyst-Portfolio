* How has income growth differed between the two major developing economies, China and India?
* Is there a correlation between rising per capita income levels and electricity usage per person?

## Datasets
The following datasets were wrangled:
* GDP by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
* Citizen Income Per Capita $ Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
* Electricity consumption per person
* Number of cellphones owned per 100 people
* % of internet users by country
* Total annual oil consumption per country

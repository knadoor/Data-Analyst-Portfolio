# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
This repository is for the projects I've done on the [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

The program prepares me for a career as a Data Analyst / Analytics professional by helping me learn:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Wrangling
- Data Cleaning
- Practical Statistics (i.e. applying inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, like analyzing A/B tests.)
- SQL for Data Analysis
- Data Visualization to draw meaningful conclusions

Whilst I previously already have experience with Python, this course has prepared me to use Python for the purposes of Data Analysis and Visualization using libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn by building a series of projects.
